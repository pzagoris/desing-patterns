It is _behav­ioral_ design pat­tern that defines the skele­ton of an algo­rithm in the super­class 
but lets sub­class­es over­ride spe­cif­ic steps of the algo­rithm with­out chang­ing its structure.

## Use

1. Use the pat­tern when you have sev­er­al class­es that con­tain almost iden­ti­cal algo­rithms with some minor dif­fer­ences.
2. Use the pat­tern when you want to let clients extend only par­tic­u­lar steps of an algo­rithm, but not the whole algo­rithm or its structure.
